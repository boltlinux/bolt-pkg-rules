        <summary>Asynchronous event notification library</summary>
        <p>
        Libevent is an asynchronous event notification library that provides a
        mechanism to execute a callback function when a specific event occurs
        on a file descriptor or after a timeout has been reached.
        </p>
        <p>
        It is meant to replace the asynchronous event loop found in
        event driven network servers. Currently, libevent supports /dev/poll,
        kqueue(2), event ports, select(2), poll(2) and epoll(4).
        </p>
        <p>
        For backward compatibility and to transition to "libevent_core only"
        or "libevent_core + libevent_extra", the libevent source package builds
        the libevent library that includes everything in libevent_core and
        libevent_extra.
        </p>
