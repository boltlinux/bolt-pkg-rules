        <summary>Asynchronous event notification library (openssl)</summary>
        <p>
        Libevent is an asynchronous event notification library that provides a
        mechanism to execute a callback function when a specific event occurs
        on a file descriptor or after a timeout has been reached.
        </p>
        <p>
        It is meant to replace the asynchronous event loop found in
        event driven network servers. Currently, libevent supports /dev/poll,
        kqueue(2), event ports, select(2), poll(2) and epoll(4).
        </p>
        <p>
        There is now a bufferevent type that supports SSL/TLS using the
        OpenSSL library. The code for this is build in a separate
        library, libevent_openssl, so that your programs don't need to
        link against OpenSSL unless they actually want SSL support.
