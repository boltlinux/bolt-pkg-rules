        <summary>Asynchronous event notification library (pthreads)</summary>
        <p>
        Libevent is an asynchronous event notification library that provides a
        mechanism to execute a callback function when a specific event occurs
        on a file descriptor or after a timeout has been reached.
        </p>
        <p>
        It is meant to replace the asynchronous event loop found in
        event driven network servers. Currently, libevent supports /dev/poll,
        kqueue(2), event ports, select(2), poll(2) and epoll(4).
        </p>
        <p>
        If you want threading support and you're using pthreads, you'll need
        to link against the libevent_pthreads library in addition to
        libevent_core.
