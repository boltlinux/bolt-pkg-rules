        <summary>Extended attribute static libraries and headers</summary>
        <p>
        attr-dev contains the libraries and header files needed to develop
        programs which make use of extended attributes. For Linux programs,
        the documented system call API is the recommended interface, but an
        SGI IRIX compatibility interface is also provided.
        </p>
        <p>
        Currently only ext2, ext3, JFS and XFS support extended attributes.
        The SGI IRIX compatibility API built above the Linux system calls is
        used by programs such as xfsdump(8), xfsrestore(8) and xfs_fsr(8).
