        <summary>automated text file generator</summary>
        <p>
        AutoGen is a tool designed for generating program files that contain
        repetitive text with varied substitutions. This is especially valuable if
        there are several blocks of such text that must be kept synchronized.
        </p>
        <p>
        Included with AutoGen is a tool that virtually eliminates the hassle of
        processing options, keeping usage text up to date and so on. This tool
        allows you to specify several program attributes, innumerable options and
        option attributes, then it produces all the code necessary to parse and
        handle the command line and initialization file options.
