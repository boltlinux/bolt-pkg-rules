        <summary>FreeBSD implementations of 'tar' and 'cpio' and other archive tools</summary>
        <p>
        This package contains several command-line tools based on the libarchive
        library.
        </p>
        <p>
        The bsdtar program is the default system 'tar' program used on FreeBSD. bsdtar
        uses the libarchive library as a backend which does all of the work for reading
        and writing archives in various formats.
        </p>
        <p>
        The bsdcpio program is the default system 'cpio' program used on FreeBSD.
        bsdcpio uses the libarchive library as a backend which does all of the work for
        reading and writing archives in various formats.
        </p>
        <p>
        The bsdcat program reads archived data from files or from its standard input
        and uses the libarchive library to decompresses it to its standard output.
        It may be used for viewing the contents of archives or for passing it to other
        tools for further processing.
        </p>
