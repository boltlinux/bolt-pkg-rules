        <summary>Multi-format archive and compression library (shared library)</summary>
        <p>
        The libarchive library provides a flexible interface for reading and writing
        archives in various formats such as tar and cpio. libarchive also supports
        reading and writing archives compressed using various compression filters such
        as gzip and bzip2. The library is inherently stream-oriented; readers serially
        iterate through the archive, writers serially add things to the archive.
        </p>
        <p>
        This package provides the libarchive shared library.
