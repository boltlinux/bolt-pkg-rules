        <summary>small build system closest in spirit to Make</summary>
        <p>
        Ninja is yet another build system. It takes as input the interdependencies of
        files (typically source code and output executables) and orchestrates
        building them, quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
        Ninja joins a sea of other build systems. Its distinguishing goal is to be
        fast. It is born from the Chromium browser project, which has over 30,000
        source files and whose other build systems can take ten seconds to start
        building after changing one file. Ninja is under a second.
