        <summary>low level cryptographic library (development files)</summary>
        <p>
        Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or
        less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (C++,
        Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel
        space.
        </p>
        <p>
        It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic 
        algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
        context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
        doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
        cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
        in any way it needs.

        This package contains the development files (C headers and static libraries)
