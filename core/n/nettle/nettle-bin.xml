        <summary>Low level cryptographic library (binary tools)</summary>
        <p>
        Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or
        less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (C++,
        Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel
        space.
        </p>
        <p>
        It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic 
        algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
        context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
        doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
        cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
        in any way it needs.
        </p>
        <p>
        This package contains binary utilities that accompany the library:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>nettle-lfib-stream - generates a pseudo-random stream, using
                the Knuth lfib (non-cryptographic) pseudo-random generator.</li>
            <li>sexp-conv - conversion tool for handling the different flavours of sexp
                syntax.</li>
            <li>pkcs1-conv - converts PKCS#1 keys to sexp format.</li>
            <li>nettle-hash - command-line tool to compute message digests such as SHA-1.</li>
        </ul>
