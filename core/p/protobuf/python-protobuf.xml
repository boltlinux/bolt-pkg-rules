        <summary>Python bindings for protocol buffers</summary>
        <p>
        Protocol buffers are a flexible, efficient, automated mechanism for
        serializing structured data - similar to XML, but smaller, faster, and
        simpler. You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can
        use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured
        data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages.
        You can even update your data structure without breaking deployed programs
        that are compiled against the "old" format.
        </p>
        <p>
        Google uses Protocol Buffers for almost all of its internal RPC protocols and
        file formats.
        </p>
        <p>
        This package contains the Python bindings for the protocol buffers. You will
        need the protoc tool (in the protobuf-compiler package) to compile your
        definition to Python classes, and then the modules in this package will allow
        you to use those classes in your programs.
