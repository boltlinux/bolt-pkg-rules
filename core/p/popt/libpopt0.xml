        <p>
        Popt was heavily influenced by the getopt() and getopt_long() functions,
        but it allows more powerful argument expansion. It can parse arbitrary
        argv[] style arrays and automatically set variables based on command
        line arguments. It also allows command line arguments to be aliased via
        configuration files and includes utility functions for parsing arbitrary
        strings into argv[] arrays using shell-like rules.
        </p>

        This package contains the runtime library and locale data.
