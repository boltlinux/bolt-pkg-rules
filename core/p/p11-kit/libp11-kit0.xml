        <summary>Library for loading and coordinating access to PKCS#11 modules - runtime</summary>
        <p>
        The p11-kit library provides a way to load and enumerate Public-Key
        Cryptography Standard #11 modules, along with a standard configuration
        setup for installing PKCS#11 modules so that they're discoverable. It
        also solves problems with coordinating the use of PKCS#11 by different
        components or libraries living in the same process.
        </p>
        <p>
        This package contains the shared library required for applications loading
        and accessing PKCS#11 modules.
