        <summary>Protocol Buffers C static library and headers (protobuf-c)</summary>
        <p>
        Protocol Buffers are a flexible, efficient, automated mechanism for
        serializing structured data - similar to XML, but smaller, faster, and
        simpler. You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can
        use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured
        data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages.
        You can even update your data structure without breaking deployed programs
        that are compiled against the "old" format.
        </p>
        <p>
        This is the "protobuf-c" implementation of Protocol Buffers in C.
        </p>
        <p>
        This package contains the static library and development headers.
