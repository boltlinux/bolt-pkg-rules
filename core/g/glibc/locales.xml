        Machine-readable data files, shared objects and programs used by the
        C library for localization (l10n) and internationalization (i18n) support.

        This package contains tools to generate locale definitions from source
        files (included in this package). It allows you to customize which
        definitions actually get generated. This is a space-saver over how this
        package used to be, with all locales generated by default. This created
        a package that unpacked to an excess of 30 megs.
