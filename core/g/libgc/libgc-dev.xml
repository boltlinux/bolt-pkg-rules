        <summary>conservative garbage collector for C (development)</summary>
        <p>
        Boehm-Demers-Weiser's GC is a garbage collecting storage allocator that is
        intended to be used as a plug-in replacement for C's malloc or C++'s new().
        </p>
        <p>
        It allows you to allocate memory basically as you normally would without
        explicitly deallocating memory that is no longer useful. The collector
        automatically recycles memory when it determines that it can no longer be
        used.
        </p>
        <p>
        This version of the collector is thread safe, has C++ support and uses the
        defaults for everything else. However, it does not work as a drop-in malloc(3)
        replacement.
