        <summary>GNU privacy guard - signature verification tool</summary>
        <p>
        GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage.

        <p>
        gpgv is actually a stripped-down version of gpg which is only able
        to check signatures. It is somewhat smaller than the fully-blown gpg
        and uses a different (and simpler) way to check that the public keys
        used to make the signature are valid. There are no configuration
        files and only a few options are implemented.
