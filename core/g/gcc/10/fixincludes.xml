        <summary>Fix non-ANSI header files</summary>
        <p>
        FixIncludes was created to fix non-ANSI system header files. Many
        system manufacturers supply proprietary headers that are not ANSI compliant.
        The GNU compilers cannot compile non-ANSI headers. Consequently, the
        FixIncludes shell script was written to fix the header files.
