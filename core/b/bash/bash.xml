        Bash is an sh-compatible command language interpreter that executes
        commands read from the standard input or from a file. Bash also
        incorporates useful features from the Korn and C shells (ksh and csh).
        </p>
        <p>
        Bash is ultimately intended to be a conformant implementation of the
        IEEE POSIX Shell and Tools specification (IEEE Working Group 1003.2).

        The Programmable Completion Code, by Ian Macdonald, is now found in
        the bash-completion package.
