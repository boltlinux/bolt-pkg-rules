        <summary>YACC-compatible parser generator - development library</summary>
        <p>
        Bison is a general-purpose parser generator that converts a
        grammar description for an LALR(1) context-free grammar into a C
        program to parse that grammar. Once you are proficient with Bison, you
        may use it to develop a wide range of language parsers, from those used
        in simple desk calculators to complex programming languages.

        This package provides the liby.a file including functions needed by
        yacc parsers.
