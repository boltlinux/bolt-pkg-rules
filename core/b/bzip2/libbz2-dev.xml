        <summary>High-quality block-sorting file compressor library - development</summary>
        <p>
        bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, high-quality data compressor.
        It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best available
        techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six
        times faster at decompression.
        </p>
        <p>
        This package contains the static libraries and include files for the bzip2
        compressor library.
