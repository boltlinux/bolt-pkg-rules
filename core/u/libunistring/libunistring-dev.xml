        <summary>Unicode string library for C - development files</summary>
        <p>
        The 'libunistring' library implements Unicode strings (in the UTF-8,
        UTF-16, and UTF-32 encodings), together with functions for Unicode
        characters (character names, classifications, properties) and
        functions for string processing (formatted output, width, word
        breaks, line breaks, normalization, case folding, regular
        expressions).
        </p>
        <p>
        This package contains the development support files needed to compile
        and link against libunistring, as well as the documentation in Info
        and HTML format.
