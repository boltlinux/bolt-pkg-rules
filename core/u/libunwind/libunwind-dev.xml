        <summary>library to determine the call-chain of a program - development</summary>
        <p>
        The primary goal of this project is to define a portable and efficient C
        programming interface (API) to determine the call-chain of a program.
        The API additionally provides the means to manipulate the preserved
        (callee-saved) state of each call-frame and to resume execution at any
        point in the call-chain (non-local goto). The API supports both local
        (same-process) and remote (across-process) operation. As such, the API
        is useful in a number of applications.
