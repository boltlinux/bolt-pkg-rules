        <summary>Reimplementation of the 'host' command</summary>
        <p>
        This package provides the 'unbound-host' program that is bundled with the
        Unbound domain name server. This version differs from the one provided in the
        package called host, which is from NIKHEF, and bind9-host, which is from ISC,
        and has a similar but different set of features and options.
