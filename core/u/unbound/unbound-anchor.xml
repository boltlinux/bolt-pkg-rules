        <summary>Utility to securely fetch the root DNS trust anchor</summary>
        <p>
        unbound-anchor is a utility which securely fetches or updates the root DNS
        zone trust anchor. A copy of the current root anchor and root update
        certificate is embedded in unbound-anchor. RFC 5011 trust anchor tracking is
        performed, with fallback to an SSL fetch if this fails.
