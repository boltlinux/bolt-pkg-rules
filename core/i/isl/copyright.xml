Oren Patashnik (PATASHNIK@SCORE.STANFORD.EDU), and the 'named' BibTeX
style of Peter F. Patel-Schneider.

Copying of this file is authorized only if either
(1) you make absolutely no changes to your copy, including name, or
(2) if you do make changes, you name it something other than 'newapa.bst'.
There are undoubtably bugs in this style.

This style was made from 'plain.bst', 'named.bst', and 'apalike.bst',
with lots of tweaking to make it look like APA style, along with tips
from Young Ryu and Brian Reiser's modifications of 'apalike.bst'.
