        <p>
        GNU Make is a utility which controls the generation of executables
        and other target files of a program from the program's source
        files. It determines automatically which pieces of a large program
        need to be (re)created, and issues the commands to (re)create
        them. Make can be used to organize any task in which targets (files)
        are to be automatically updated based on input files whenever the
        corresponding input is newer --- it is not limited to building
        computer programs. Indeed, Make is a general purpose dependency
        solver.
