            <summary>A small, standards-conformling libc for Linux</summary>
            <p>
                musl provides consistent quality and implementation behavior
            from tiny embedded systems to full-fledged servers. Minimal
            machine-specific code means less chance of breakage on minority
            architectures and better success with “write once run everywhere”
            C development.
            </p>
            <p>
                musl's efficiency is unparalleled in Linux libc implementations.
            Designed from the ground up for static linking, musl carefully avoids
            pulling in large amounts of code or data that the application will
            not use. Dynamic linking is also efficient; by integrating the entire
            standard library implementation, including threads, math, and even the
            dynamic linker itself into a single shared object, most of the startup
            time and memory overhead of dynamic linking have been eliminated.
            </p>
