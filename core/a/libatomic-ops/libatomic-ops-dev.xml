        <summary>A library for atomic operations (development files)</summary>
        <p>
        Libatomic-ops implements a large collection of operations, each one
        of which is a combination of an (optional) atomic memory operation,
        and a memory barrier. It also implements associated feature-test
        macros that determine whether a particular operation is available
        on the current target hardware (either directly or by synthesis).
        Libatomic-ops attempts to replace various existing files with similar
        goals, since they usually do not handle differences in memory barrier
        styles with sufficient generality.

        This package provides the header files and documentation needed by
        developers.
