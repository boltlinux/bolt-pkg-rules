Under Section 7 of GPL version 3, you are granted additional
permissions described in the Autoconf Configure Script Exception,
version 3.0, as published by the Free Software Foundation.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
and a copy of the Autoconf Configure Script Exception along with
this program; see the files COPYINGv3 and COPYING.EXCEPTION
respectively.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

The Autoconf Configure Script Exception version 3 is below:

		    AUTOCONF CONFIGURE SCRIPT EXCEPTION
			Version 3.0, 18 August 2009

Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This Exception is an additional permission under section 7 of the GNU
General Public License, version 3 ("GPLv3").  It applies to a given
file that bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file
stating that the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

The purpose of this Exception is to allow distribution of Autoconf's
typical output under terms of the recipient's choice (including
proprietary).

0. Definitions

"Covered Code" is the source or object code of a version of Autoconf
that is a covered work under this License.

"Normally Copied Code" for a version of Autoconf means all parts of
its Covered Code which that version can copy from its code (i.e., not
from its input file) into its minimally verbose, non-debugging and
non-tracing output.

"Ineligible Code" is Covered Code that is not Normally Copied Code.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.

You have permission to propagate output of Autoconf, even if such
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3.  However, if
by modifying Autoconf you cause any Ineligible Code of the version you
received to become Normally Copied Code of your modified version, then
you void this Exception for the resulting covered work.  If you convey
that resulting covered work, you must remove this Exception in accordance
with the second paragraph of Section 7 of GPLv3.

2. No Weakening of Autoconf Copyleft.

The availability of this Exception does not imply any general presumption
that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft requirements of
the license of Autoconf.
