        <summary>Practical and portable Scheme system - runtime</summary>
        <p>
        CHICKEN is a Scheme compiler which compiles a subset of R5RS into C. 
        It uses the ideas presented in Baker's paper "Cheney on the MTA", and 
        has a small core and is easily extendable.

        chicken.
