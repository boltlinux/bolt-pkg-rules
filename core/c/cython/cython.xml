        <summary>C-Extensions for Python</summary>
        <p>
        Cython is a language that makes writing C extensions for the Python language as
        easy as Python itself. Cython is based on the well-known Pyrex, but supports
        more cutting edge functionality and optimizations.
        </p>
        <p>
        The Cython language is very close to the Python language, but Cython
        additionally supports calling C functions and declaring C types on variables
        and class attributes. This allows the compiler to generate very efficient C
        code from Cython code.
        </p>
        <p>
        This makes Cython the ideal language for wrapping external C libraries, and
        for fast C modules that speed up the execution of Python code.
