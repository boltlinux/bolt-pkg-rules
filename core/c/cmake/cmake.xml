        <p>
        CMake is used to control the software compilation process using
        simple platform and compiler independent configuration files. CMake
        generates native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the
        compiler environment of your choice. CMake is quite sophisticated: it
        is possible to support complex environments requiring system
        configuration, pre-processor generation, code generation, and template
        instantiation.
