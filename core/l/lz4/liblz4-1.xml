        <summary>Fast LZ compression algorithm library - runtime</summary>
        <p>
        LZ4 is a very fast lossless compression algorithm, providing compression speed
        at 400 MB/s per core, scalable with multi-cores CPU. It also features an
        extremely fast decoder, with speed in multiple GB/s per core, typically
        reaching RAM speed limits on multi-core systems.
