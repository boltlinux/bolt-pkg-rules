        <summary>LDNS library for DNS programming</summary>
        <p>
        The goal of ldns is to simplify DNS programming, it supports recent RFCs
        like the DNSSEC documents, and allows developers to easily create software
        conforming to current RFCs, and experimental software for current Internet
        Drafts.
        </p>
        <p>
        This package contains various client programs related to DNS that are
        based on top of libldns library and DRILL tool which is similar to dig.
        These tools were designed with DNSSEC in mind and are useful for DNS
        and DNSSEC testing and debugging.
