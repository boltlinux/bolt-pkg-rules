        <summary>Python3 bindings for the ldns library for DNS programming</summary>
        <p>
        The goal of ldns is to simplify DNS programming, it supports recent RFCs
        like the DNSSEC documents, and allows developers to easily create software
        conforming to current RFCs, and experimental software for current Internet
        Drafts.
        </p>
        <p>
        This archive contains modules that allow you to use LDNS Library in
        Python3 programs.
