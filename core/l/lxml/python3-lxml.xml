        <summary>pythonic binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries</summary>
        <p>
        lxml is a new Python binding for libxml2 and libxslt, completely
        independent from existing Python bindings. Its aim:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pythonic API.</li>
          <li>Documented.</li>
          <li>Use Python unicode strings in API.</li>
          <li>Safe (no segfaults).</li>
          <li>No manual memory management!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        lxml aims to provide a Pythonic API by following as much as possible
        the ElementTree API, trying to avoid inventing too many new APIs,
        or the user's having to learn new things -- XML is complicated enough.
