        <p>
        strace is a system call tracer: i.e. a debugging tool which prints out
        a trace of all the system calls made by another process/program.
        The program to be traced need not be recompiled for this, so you can
        use it on binaries for which you don't have source.
        </p>
        <p>
        System calls and signals are events that happen at the user/kernel
        interface. A close examination of this boundary is very useful for bug
        isolation, sanity checking and attempting to capture race conditions.
