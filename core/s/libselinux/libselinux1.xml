        <summary>SELinux runtime shared libraries</summary>
        <p>
        This package provides the shared libraries for Security-enhanced
        Linux that provides interfaces (e.g. library functions for the
        SELinux kernel APIs like getcon(), other support functions like
        getseuserbyname()) to SELinux-aware applications. Security-enhanced
        Linux is a patch of the Linux kernel and a number of utilities with
        enhanced security functionality designed to add mandatory access
        controls to Linux. The Security-enhanced Linux kernel contains new
        architectural components originally developed to improve the security
        of the Flask operating system. These architectural components provide
        general support for the enforcement of many kinds of mandatory access
        control policies, including those based on the concepts of Type
        Enforcement, Role-based Access Control, and Multi-level Security.

        <p>
        libselinux1 provides an API for SELinux applications to get and set
        process and file security contexts and to obtain security policy
        decisions. Required for any applications that use the SELinux
        API. libselinux may use the shared libsepol to manipulate the binary
        policy if necessary (e.g. to downgrade the policy format to an older
        version supported by the kernel) when loading policy.
