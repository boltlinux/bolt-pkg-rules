        <summary>dependency solver using a satisfiability algorithm (command-line tools)</summary>
        <p>
        This dependency solver code in this package is based on two major, but
        independent, blocks:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Using a dictionary approach to store and retrieve package
              and dependency information.</li>
          <li>Using satisfiability, a well known and researched topic, for
              resolving package dependencies.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        This package contains command-line tools that facilitate using libsolv.
