Debian maintainers' note:

This is Debian's prepackaged version of Andrew Tridgell and Paul Mackerras'
rsync utility.

This package provides the rsync program, which is a replacement for rcp that
uses the rsync algorythm to transfer only the differences between two sets of
files.

This package was put together by Philip Hands <phil@hands.com>, from sources
obtained from:

    http://rsync.samba.org/ftp/rsync/rsync-2.5.4.tar.gz

The current version was downloaded from:

    https://rsync.samba.org/ftp/rsync/src/rsync-3.1.3.tar.gz

on 2018-12-02 by Samuel Henrique <samueloph@debian.org>.

The changes were very minimal - merely adding support for the Debian
package maintenance scheme by adding various debian/* files.
The only significant change is passing the -4 / -6 options through to ssh.
See the debian/patches/ directory.
