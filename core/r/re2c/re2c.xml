        <summary>lexer generator for C, C++ and Go</summary>
        <p>
        re2c's main goal is generating fast lexers: at least as fast as
        their reasonably optimized hand-coded counterparts. Instead of using
        a traditional table-driven approach, re2c encodes the generated
        finite state automata directly in the form of conditional jumps and
        comparisons. The resulting programs are faster and often smaller
        than their table-driven analogues, and they are much easier to debug
        and understand. Quite a few optimizations are applied in order to
        speed up and compress the generated code.
        </p>
        <p>
        Another distinctive feature is its flexible interface: instead of
        assuming a fixed program template, re2c lets the programmer write
        most of the interface code and adapt the generated lexer to any
        particular environment.
