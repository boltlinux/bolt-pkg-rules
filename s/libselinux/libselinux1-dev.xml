        <summary>SELinux development headers</summary>
        <p>
        This package provides the static libraries and header files
        needed for developing SELinux applications. Security-enhanced Linux
        is a patch of the Linux kernel and a number of utilities with
        enhanced security functionality designed to add mandatory access
        controls to Linux. The Security-enhanced Linux kernel contains new
        architectural components originally developed to improve the security
        of the Flask operating system. These architectural components provide
        general support for the enforcement of many kinds of mandatory access
        control policies, including those based on the concepts of Type
        Enforcement, Role-based Access Control, and Multi-level Security.
