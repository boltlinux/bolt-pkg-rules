            <summary>SELinux utility programs and libraries</summary>
            <p>
            This package provides the shared libraries for Security-enhanced
            Linux that provides interfaces (e.g. library functions for the
            SELinux kernel APIs like getcon(), other support functions like
            getseuserbyname()) to SELinux-aware applications. Security-enhanced
            Linux is a patch of the Linux kernel and a number of utilities with
            enhanced security functionality designed to add mandatory access
            controls to Linux. The Security-enhanced Linux kernel contains new
            architectural components originally developed to improve the security
            of the Flask operating system. These architectural components provide
            general support for the enforcement of many kinds of mandatory access
            control policies, including those based on the concepts of Type
            Enforcement, Role-based Access Control, and Multi-level Security.
            </p>

            This package also provides various utility programs for a Security-enhanced
            Linux system. Security-enhanced Linux is a patch of the Linux kernel
            and a number of utilities with enhanced security functionality
            designed to add mandatory access controls to Linux. This package
            provides utility programs to get and set process and file security
            contexts and to obtain security policy decisions.
