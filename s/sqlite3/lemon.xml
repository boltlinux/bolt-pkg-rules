        <summary>LALR(1) Parser Generator for C or C++</summary>
        <p>
        Lemon is an LALR(1) parser generator for C or C++. It does the same
        job as bison and yacc. But lemon is not another bison or yacc
        clone. It uses a different grammar syntax which is designed to reduce
        the number of coding errors. Lemon also uses a more sophisticated
        parsing engine that is faster than yacc and bison and which is both
        reentrant and thread-safe. Furthermore, Lemon implements features
        that can be used to eliminate resource leaks, making is suitable for
        use in long-running programs such as graphical user interfaces or
        embedded controllers.
