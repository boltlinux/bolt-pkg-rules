        <p>
        This package provides a utility for a Security-enhanced
        Linux system to rewrite existing mandatory access control policy with
        different boolean setting, generating a new policy. Security-enhanced
        Linux is a patch of the Linux kernel and a number of utilities with
        enhanced security functionality designed to add mandatory access
        controls to Linux. This package provides utility programs to get and
        set process and file security contexts and to obtain security policy
        decisions.
