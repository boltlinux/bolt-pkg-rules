            <summary>SELinux library for manipulating binary security policies</summary>
            <p>
            Security-enhanced Linux is a patch of the Linux kernel and a number
            of utilities with enhanced security functionality designed to add
            mandatory access controls to Linux. The Security-enhanced Linux
            kernel contains new architectural components originally developed to
            improve the security of the Flask operating system. These
            architectural components provide general support for the enforcement
            of many kinds of mandatory access control policies, including those
            based on the concepts of Type EnforcementÂ®, Role-based Access
            Control, and Multi-level Security.

            libsepol provides an API for the manipulation of SELinux binary policies.
            It is used by checkpolicy (the policy compiler) and similar tools, as well
            as by programs like load_policy that need to perform specific transformations
            on binary policies such as customizing policy boolean settings.
