        <summary>manipulating sets and relations of integer points bounded by linear constraints</summary>
        <p>
        isl is a library for manipulating sets and relations of integer points
        bounded by linear constraints. Supported operations on sets include
        intersection, union, set difference, emptiness check, convex hull,
        (integer) affine hull, integer projection, and computing the lexicographic
        minimum using parametric integer programming. It also includes an ILP solver
        based on generalized basis reduction.
