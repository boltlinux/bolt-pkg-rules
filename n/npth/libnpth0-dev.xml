        <p>
        nPth is a non-preemptive threads implementation using an API very
        similar to the one known from GNU Pth. It has been designed as a
        replacement of GNU Pth for non-ancient operating systems. In
        contrast to GNU Pth it is based on the system's standard threads
        implementation. Thus nPth allows the use of libraries which are not
        compatible to GNU Pth.
