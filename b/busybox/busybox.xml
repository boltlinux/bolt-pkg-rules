        <p>
        BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single
        small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for the most common
        utilities you would usually find on your desktop system (i.e., ls, cp, mv,
        mount, tar, etc.). The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than
        their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included
        provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU
        counterparts.
        </p>
        <p>
        This package installs the BusyBox binary but does not install
        symlinks for any of the supported utilities.
