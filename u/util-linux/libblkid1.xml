        <summary>block device ID library</summary>
        <p>
        The blkid library allows system programs such as fsck and mount to
        quickly and easily find block devices by filesystem UUID or label.
        This allows system administrators to avoid specifying filesystems by
        hard-coded device names and use a logical naming system instead.
