        <summary>Linux headers that libc was compiled against</summary>
        <p>
        This package contains the headers that were used to compile the
        libc in your system. These headers are independent of the headers
        belonging to your running kernel. If you want the headers corresponding
        to your kernel image, install linux-`uname -r`-headers instead.
