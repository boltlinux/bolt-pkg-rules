        <p>
        Zsh is a UNIX command interpreter (shell) usable as an
        interactive login shell and as a shell script command
        processor. Of the standard shells, zsh most closely resembles
        ksh but includes many enhancements. Zsh has command-line editing,
        built-in spelling correction, programmable command completion,
        shell functions (with autoloading), a history mechanism, and a
        host of other features.
