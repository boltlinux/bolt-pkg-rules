        <summary>Frame Streams (fstrm) library (utilities)</summary>
        <p>
        Frame Streams is a light weight, binary clean protocol that allows for the
        transport of arbitrarily encoded data payload sequences with minimal framing
        overhead -- just four bytes per data frame. Frame Streams does not specify an
        encoding format for data frames and can be used with any data serialization
        format that produces byte sequences, such as Protocol Buffers, XML, JSON,
        MessagePack, YAML, etc. Frame Streams can be used as both a streaming
        transport over a reliable byte stream socket (TCP sockets, TLS connections,
        AF_UNIX sockets, etc.) for data in motion as well as a file format for data
        at rest. A "Content Type" header identifies the type of payload being carried
        over an individual Frame Stream and allows cooperating programs to determine
        how to interpret a given sequence of data payloads.

        <p>
        This is the "fstrm" implementation of Frame Streams in C.
