        <summary>Utilities for analysing and setting file capabilities</summary>
        <p>
        This library implements the user-space interfaces to the POSIX
        1003.1e capabilities available in Linux kernels. These capabilities are
        a partitioning of the all powerful root privilege into a set of distinct
        privileges.
        </p>
        <p>
        The libcap-ng library is intended to make programming with POSIX
        capabilities much easier than the traditional libcap library.
        </p>
        <p>
        This package contains utilities for analysing and setting file capabilities.
