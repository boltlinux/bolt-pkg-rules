The "chrpath" program was written by

Geoffrey Keating <geoffk@ozemail.com.au>
  Implemented first version of chrpath.c based on first version of
  killrpath.
Peeter Joot <peeterj@ca.ibm.com>
  Implemented first version of killrpath.c.
Petter Reinholdtsen <pere@hungry.com>
  Collected both implementations and made userfriendly wrapper.
Javier Serrano Polo <jasp00@terra.es>
  Made it arch-independent so it can be used for cross-development.
