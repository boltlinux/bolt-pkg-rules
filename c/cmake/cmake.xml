        <p>
        CMake is used to control the software compilation process using
        simple platform and compiler independent configuration files. CMake
        generates native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the
        compiler environment of your choice. CMake is quite sophisticated: it
        is possible to support complex environments requiring system
        configuration, pre-processor generation, code generation, and template
        instantiation.

        <p>
        CMake was developed by Kitware as part of the NLM Insight
        Segmentation and Registration Toolkit project. The ASCI VIEWS project
        also provided support in the context of their parallel computation
        environment. Other sponsors include the Insight, VTK, and VXL open
        source software communities.
