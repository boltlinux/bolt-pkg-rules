        <summary>curses based user interface for CMake (ccmake)</summary>
        <p>
        CMake is used to control the software compilation process using simple
        platform and compiler independent configuration files. CMake generates native
        makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the compiler environment of your
        choice.
        </p>
        <p>
        This package provides the CMake curses interface. Project configuration
        settings may be specified interactively through this GUI. Brief instructions
        are provided at the bottom of the terminal when the program is running. The
        main executable file for this GUI is "ccmake".
