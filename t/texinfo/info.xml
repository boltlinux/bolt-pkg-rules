        <p>
        The Info file format is an easily-parsable representation for online
        documents. This program allows you to view Info documents, like the
        ones stored in /usr/share/info.

        Much of the software in Debian comes with its online documentation in
        the form of Info files, so it is most likely you will want to install it.
