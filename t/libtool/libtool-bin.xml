        <summary>Generic library support script (libtool binary)</summary>
        <p>
        This is GNU libtool, a generic library support script. Libtool hides
        the complexity of generating special library types (such as shared
        libraries) behind a consistent interface. To use libtool, add the
        new generic library building commands to your Makefile, Makefile.in,
        or Makefile.am. See the documentation for details. Libtool supports
        building static libraries on all platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
        Libtool supports generation of C, C++, Fortran and Java libraries.
        </p>
        <p>
        This package contains the libtool binary only.
