        <p>
        Tar is a program for packaging a set of files as a single archive in tar
        format. The function it performs is conceptually similar to cpio, and to
        things like PKZIP in the DOS world. It is heavily used by the Debian package
        management system, and is useful for performing system backups and exchanging
        sets of files with others.
