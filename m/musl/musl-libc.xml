        <summary>A small, standards-conformling libc for Linux (runtime)</summary>
        <p>
            musl provides consistent quality and implementation behavior
        from tiny embedded systems to full-fledged servers. Minimal
        machine-specific code means less chance of breakage on minority
        architectures and better success with “write once run everywhere”
        C development.
        </p>
        <p>
            musl's efficiency is unparalleled in Linux libc implementations.
        Designed from the ground up for static linking, musl carefully avoids
        pulling in large amounts of code or data that the application will
        not use. Dynamic linking is also efficient; by integrating the entire
        standard library implementation, including threads, math, and even the
        dynamic linker itself into a single shared object, most of the startup
        time and memory overhead of dynamic linking have been eliminated.
        </p>
        <p>
            This package contains the runtime library and dynamic linker.
