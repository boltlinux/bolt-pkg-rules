        <summary>OPKG - tiny yet powerful package manager (development)</summary>
        <p>
            Opkg is a lightweight package management system. It is written in C and resembles
        apt/dpkg in operation. It is intended for use on embedded Linux devices.
        </p>
        <p>
            Opkg is maintained, stable, robust and conservative in its memory usage. As best it
        can, opkg maintains backwards compatibility with ipkg and conforms to a subset of
        Debian's Policy Manual regarding control files.
        </p>
        <p>
            This package contains headers and libraries for development.
