        <summary>XZ-format compression utilities - tiny decompressors</summary>
        <p>
        XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm
        compression format, which provides memory-hungry but powerful
        compression (often better than bzip2) and fast, easy decompression.
        </p>
        <p>
        This package provides the xzdec and lzmadec utilities, which write
        the decompressed version of a compressed file to standard output. The
        binaries are very small, so they can be easily stored on small media
        with some compressed files, and they are linked statically against
        liblzma so they can be used on machines without a compatible version
        of liblzma installed. However, they have:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>no compression support;</li>
          <li>no support for writing to a file other than standard output;</li>
          <li>no translated messages;</li>
          <li>been optimized for size rather than speed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        For a full-featured xzcat command without these limitations, use
        the xz-utils package instead.
