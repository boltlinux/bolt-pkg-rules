        <summary>Fix non-ANSI header files</summary>
        <p>
        FixIncludes was created to fix non-ANSI system header files. Many
        system manufacturers supply proprietary headers that are not ANSI compliant.
        The GNU compilers cannot compile non-ANSI headers. Consequently, the
        FixIncludes shell script was written to fix the header files.
        </p>
        <p>
        Not all packages with header files are installed on the system, when the
        package is built, so we make fixincludes available at build time of other
        packages, such that checking tools like lintian can make use of it.
