        <summary>GNU privacy guard - signature verification tool (dummy transitional package)</summary>
        <p>
        GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage. gpgv
        is a stripped-down version of gpg which is only able to check
        signatures.
        </p>
        <p>
        This is a dummy transitional package that provides symlinks from gpgv2
        to gpgv.
