        <p>
        This development package provides the header files and the symbolic
        links to allow compilation and linking of programs that use the libraries
        provided in the libgmp10 package.
        </p>
        <p>
        Both C and C++ bindings are present in this package.  Package
        libstdc++-dev is required to use the C++ bindings.  
        </p>
        <p>
        The MPFR library (multiple-precision floating-point) used to be
        included, but has since been moved to package libmpfr-dev.
