        <summary>Header files for compiling extension modules for the Ruby 2.3</summary>
        <p>
        Ruby is the interpreted scripting language for quick and easy
        object-oriented programming. It has many features to process text
        files and to do system management tasks (as in perl). It is simple,
        straight-forward, and extensible.
        </p>
        <p>
        This package contains the header files and the mkmf library, necessary
        to make extension library for Ruby 2.3. It is also required to build
        many gems.
