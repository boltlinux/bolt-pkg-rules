        <p>
        rsync is a fast and versatile file-copying tool which can copy locally
        and to/from a remote host. It offers many options to control its behavior,
        and its remote-update protocol can minimize network traffic to make
        transferring updates between machines fast and efficient.
        </p>
        <p>
        It is widely used for backups and mirroring and as an improved copy
        command for everyday use.
        </p>

        This package provides both the rsync command line tool and optional
        daemon functionality.
