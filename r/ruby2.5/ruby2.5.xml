        <p>
        Ruby is the interpreted scripting language for quick and easy
        object-oriented programming. It has many features to process text
        files and to do system management tasks (as in perl). It is simple,
        straight-forward, and extensible.
        </p>

        version. This package currently provides the `2.5.x' branch of Ruby.
