        <summary>Package Discovery and Resource Access using pkg_resources</summary>
        <p>
        The pkg_resources module provides an API for Python libraries to
        access their resource files, and for extensible applications and
        frameworks to automatically discover plugins. It also provides
        runtime support for using C extensions that are inside zipfile-format
        eggs, support for merging packages that have separately-distributed
        modules or subpackages, and APIs for managing Python's current
        "working set" of active packages.
