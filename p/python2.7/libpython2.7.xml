        <summary>Shared Python runtime library (version 2.7)</summary>
        <p>
        Python is a high-level, interactive, object-oriented language. Its 2.7 version
        includes an extensive class library with lots of goodies for
        network programming, system administration, sounds and graphics.
        </p>
        <p>
        This package contains the shared runtime library, normally not needed
        for programs using the statically linked interpreter.
