        <summary>minimal dumb-terminal PIN or pass-phrase entry for GnuPG</summary>
        <p>
        This package contains a program that allows for secure entry of PINs or
        pass phrases. That means it tries to take care that the entered
        information is not swapped to disk or temporarily stored anywhere.
        This functionality is particularly useful for entering pass phrases
        when using encryption software such as GnuPG or e-mail clients using
        the same. It uses an open protocol and is therefore not tied to
        particular software.

        <p>
        The program contained in this package implements a PIN entry prompt
        that interacts directly with the controlling terminal. It has
        minimal dependencies, meaning that it is useful for users working
        with dumb terminals or similarly constrained environments. There are
        sibling packages that implement PIN entry dialogs that use curses for
        friendlier text-mode inputs on non-dumb terminals, and other sibling
        packages that provide PIN entry dialogs using an X tool kit.
