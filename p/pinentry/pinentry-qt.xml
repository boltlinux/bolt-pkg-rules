        <summary>Qt-based PIN or pass-phrase entry dialog for GnuPG</summary>
        <p>
        This package contains a program that allows for entry of PINs or pass
        phrases. It is useful for entering pass phrases when using encryption
        software such as GnuPG or e-mail clients using the same. It uses an open
        protocol and is therefore not tied to particular software.
        </p>
        <p>
        The program contained in this package implements a PIN entry dialog
        using the Qt tool kit, so it is especially suitable for users of KDE.
        If the X Window System is not active then an alternative text-mode
        dialog will be used. There are sibling packages that implement PIN
        entry dialogs using other tool kits.
