        <summary>GNOME 3 PIN or pass-phrase entry dialog for GnuPG</summary>
        <p>
        This package contains a program that allows for secure entry of PINs or
        pass phrases. That means it tries to take care that the entered
        information is not swapped to disk or temporarily stored anywhere.
        This functionality is particularly useful for entering pass phrases
        when using encryption software such as GnuPG or e-mail clients using
        the same. It uses an open protocol and is therefore not tied to
        particular software.
        </p>
        <p>
        The program contained in this package implements a PIN entry dialog
        designed for use with GNOME 3. It tries to follow the GNOME Human
        Interface Guidelines as much as possible. If the X Window System is
        not active then an alternative text-mode dialog will be used. There
        are sibling packages that implement PIN entry dialogs using other
        tool kits.
