        <p>
        Perl is a highly capable, feature-rich programming language with over
        20 years of development. Perl 5 runs on over 100 platforms from
        portables to mainframes. Perl is suitable for both rapid prototyping
        and large scale development projects.
        </p>
        <p>
        Perl 5 supports many programming styles, including procedural,
        functional, and object-oriented. In addition to this, it is supported
        by an ever-growing collection of reusable modules which accelerate
        development. Some of these modules include Web frameworks, database
        integration, networking protocols, and encryption. Perl provides
        interfaces to C and C++ for custom extension development.
