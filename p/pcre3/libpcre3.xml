        <summary>Old Perl 5 Compatible Regular Expression Library - runtime files</summary>
        <p>
        This is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax 
        and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.
        </p>
        <p>
        New packages should use the newer pcre2 packages, and existing
        packages should migrate to pcre2.
        </p>
        <p>
        This package contains the runtime libraries.
