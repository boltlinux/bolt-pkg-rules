        <summary>Pluggable Authentication Modules library</summary>
        <p>
        Contains the shared library for Linux-PAM, a library that enables the
        local system administrator to choose how applications authenticate users.
        In other words, without rewriting or recompiling a PAM-aware application,
        it is possible to switch between the authentication mechanism(s) it uses.
        One may entirely upgrade the local authentication system without touching
        the applications themselves.
